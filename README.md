Snort Game Simulator
====================

Simulates a game of Snort, a combinatorial, two-player game invented by
Simon Norton where two players, Red and Blue alternate turns coloring a
map such that no two colors are adjacent to each other.  The game follows
normal play where the player with no moves left loses.

Usage: `$ ./snort.py`


Dependencies
------------

The simulation was written in python2.7.x and requires the following
packages:

- `networkx`
- `matplotlib`

Snort Solver
============

This package comes with a Snort solver denoted by `solver.py` which can
solve games on graphs generated by `networkx`.
